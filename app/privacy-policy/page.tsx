            <p className="mb-4">
                At Moviestremtv, your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it â€” especially since we do not require any user registration or personal data submission.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                We do not collect any personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, or contact details, as our service does not include account creation, login, or forms that request such data. However, we may collect limited non-personal information automatically to help improve our website and services, including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-4">

                <li>Pages visited and time spent on the site</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
                This data is collected in aggregate and does not identify individual users.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">2. How We Use Non-Personal Information</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                We use this information solely to:
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your browsing experience. These technologies help us:

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                We do not share or sell any personally identifiable information, because we do not collect it. Non-personal usage data may be shared with third-party analytics providers (like Google Analytics) solely for the purpose of improving site performance. We may also disclose information if legally required to do so.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Data Security</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                While we do not collect personal data, we take reasonable steps to secure our website and any traffic data we handle. However, no method of data transmission over the internet is completely secure.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">6. Your Rights</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Since we do not collect personal data, we do not store or process any information that can be linked to you. You may still choose to disable cookies or tracking in your browser settings if preferred.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">7. Updates to This Policy</h2>
